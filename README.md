# Canadian-Superstore-Analysis
A dashboard report on Superstore's sales performance in Canada between (2009 -2012)
I cleaned and analyzed the dataset spanning from 2019 to 2012, and created a one-page dashboard to visualize the sales performance. 💻📊 Thanks to Looker Studio, I was able to create an interactive visualization that provided insights into sales trends, profit, customers by business segment , and product performance and region. 📈💡 It was a great learning experience to work with real-world data and develop actionable insights for business decision-making. 💼🔍 #DataAnalysis #DataVisualization #Python #Looker #BusinessInsights #CanadianSuperstore #PortfolioProject
